# **Tower Escape Game**

## **1. Introduction**

“Hello everyone! **Tower Escape**, a fast paced, action packed 2D endless jumping game built entirely in **Unity Engine** using **C#**. This project comes with complete assets like scripts, prefabs, animations, images, and audio. Let’s dive right in!”

## **2. What the Game Is About**

“Tower Escape is designed to be simple to understand but highly addictive. The goal is straightforward: **keep climbing up the tower** by jumping on the bricks and score as high as possible. The game gets exciting very quickly as the speed increases and the bricks start behaving differently.”

---

## **3. Core Gameplay Breakdown**

“Here’s how it works:

* You start at the bottom of the tower.
* Jump from one brick to another to move upward.
* Each successful jump adds to your score.
* Some bricks stay stable, but others **start falling after a few seconds**, creating urgency.
* If you miss a jump and fall, the run ends and your final score appears.
* Controls are simple: **Arrow keys** for movement.

The simplicity makes it fun for beginners, while the increasing speed adds challenge for experienced players.”

## **4. Visual & Audio Design**

“The environment is made using layered 2D sprites to give a proper tower like vertical feel. The backgrounds, bricks, character sprites, and UI elements are all arranged using Unity’s sprite renderer.

I’ve added:

* Smooth animations
* Jump and fall sound effects
* Background music that keeps the energy high
* Crisp UI for score display and game over interface

All of these together create a lively and engaging experience.”

---

## **5. Technical Structure**

“Everything runs through Unity’s C# scripting. Some key systems include:

* **Physics based jump mechanics**
* **Timers for falling bricks**
* **Collision checks** to detect successful jumps or falls
* **Score manager** that tracks height and points
* **Game manager** that handles game over states
* **Prefabs** for repeatable objects

The project folder includes all necessary assets, structured and ready for exploration.”

---

## **6. Purpose & Educational Value**

“This project is perfect for:

* Game development learners
* Anyone studying Unity
* Beginners practicing C# scripting
* People who want to understand 2D physics and endless game mechanics

It’s free to download and can be modified, expanded, or used as a learning reference.”

## **7. Live Demo Cue**

“Now let me show you the gameplay in action. Watch the character jump, see how the bricks behave, and notice how quickly the game demands fast reactions.

After the demo, feel free to try it yourself and test how high you can climb!”
